 # Personalized Student Recommendations for Quiz Preparation
Overview
This Python-based solution analyzes quiz performance data and generates personalized recommendations to help students improve their preparation for exams. The system processes both historical and current quiz data, highlights weaknesses, and provides actionable steps for improvement.

Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and transformation.
Performance Analysis: Aggregating scores and accuracy for performance metrics.
Clustering: Grouping data using K-Means to identify patterns.
Weakness and Strength Analysis: Identifying weak and strong topics.
Recommendation Generation: Proposing topics to focus on based on weaknesses.
Visualization: Radar chart to visualize student performance.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
To run the solution, ensure you have Python installed, along with the following dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Data Files
history.csv: Historical quiz performance data.
current.csv: Latest quiz performance data.
Make sure these files are in the same directory as the script.

Steps Used in the Code
1. Data Preprocessing
The preprocess_data function cleans and prepares the data for further analysis.

ID Cleaning:
Strips whitespaces and converts Quiz ID and User ID to lowercase.
Topic Cleaning:
Converts Quiz Topic or Topic to lowercase.
Splits concatenated topics (separated by "and") into individual topics.
Maps each unique topic to a numerical index (Topic_index).
Score and Accuracy Conversion:
Converts percentage values (e.g., '85%') to numeric format by removing the '%' sign.
Handling Missing Data:
Drops rows where Score or Accuracy is missing.
python
Copy
Edit
def preprocess_data(df):
    # Data cleaning steps (stripping, converting to lowercase, splitting topics, etc.)
    ...
    return df, index_to_topic
2. Load Datasets
The history.csv and current.csv files are read using pandas:

python
Copy
Edit
history_data = pd.read_csv("history.csv")
current_data = pd.read_csv("current.csv")
The preprocess_data function is applied to both datasets to clean them.

3. Data Aggregation for Performance Metrics
Performance metrics for both historical and current quiz data are aggregated.

Historical Performance: Grouped by Topic_index, calculating the mean of Score and Accuracy.
Current Performance: Grouped by Topic_index, calculating the sum of Correct Answers and Total Questions. Then, Accuracy is computed as the ratio of Correct Answers to Total Questions.
python
Copy
Edit
history_performance = history_data.groupby("Topic_index").agg({"Score": "mean", "Accuracy": "mean"}).reset_index()
current_performance = current_data.groupby("Topic_index").agg({"Correct Answers": "sum", "Total Questions": "sum"}).reset_index()
current_performance["Accuracy"] = current_performance["Correct Answers"] / current_performance["Total Questions"]
4. Combine Data
Historical and current performance data are merged into one dataframe using the Topic_index as the key.

python
Copy
Edit
performance_data = pd.merge(history_performance, current_performance, on="Topic_index", how="outer", suffixes=("_history", "_current"))
5. Normalization
To standardize the data, we use StandardScaler to scale the Score, Accuracy_history, and Accuracy_current columns.

python
Copy
Edit
scaler = StandardScaler()
performance_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(performance_data[["Score", "Accuracy_history", "Accuracy_current", "Topic_index"]])
6. Imputation of Missing Data
After scaling, any missing values are imputed using the mean strategy to handle any NaN values that might remain.

python
Copy
Edit
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")
performance_data_scaled = imputer.fit_transform(performance_data_scaled)
7. K-Means Clustering
We use K-Means clustering to group the data into 3 clusters based on the scaled performance data.

python
Copy
Edit
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
performance_data["Cluster"] = kmeans.fit_predict(performance_data_scaled)
8. Weakness and Strength Analysis
Weak Topics: Identified by low accuracy or score (less than 0.5).
Strong Topics: Identified by high accuracy and score (greater than 0.8).
python
Copy
Edit
weak_topics = performance_data[(performance_data["Accuracy_current"] < 0.5) | (performance_data["Score"] < 0.5)]["Topic_index"].tolist()
strong_topics = performance_data[(performance_data["Accuracy_current"] > 0.8) & (performance_data["Score"] > 0.8)]["Topic_index"].tolist()
9. Generate Recommendations
The recommend_topics function suggests topics to improve based on weak topics.

python
Copy
Edit
def recommend_topics(cluster_data, weakness_list):
    recommendations = cluster_data[cluster_data["Topic_index"].isin(weakness_list)]
    return recommendations[["Topic_index", "Accuracy_current"]]
10. Visualization (Radar Chart)
A radar chart is created to visualize the performance across different metrics (Score, Accuracy_history, Accuracy_current).

python
Copy
Edit
def plot_radar_chart(data, student_id):
    categories = ["Score", "Accuracy_history", "Accuracy_current"]
    values = data.mean()[categories].tolist()
    values += values[:1]  # Repeat the first value to close the radar chart
    # Code for plotting the radar chart...
Conclusion
This solution provides a personalized recommendation system to help students improve their quiz preparation. The system identifies strengths and weaknesses and suggests relevant topics to focus on, improving performance for future quizzes.
